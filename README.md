## Building the project using make

To build the project, change the variables in the makefile within the build directory to point to the location of your SFML libraries and include files. Be sure to copy the .dll files from the SFML lib folder to the generated bin folder to dynamically link your project with SFML library. You can then run make from within the build folder, and a bin subfolder will be generated containing your executable.
